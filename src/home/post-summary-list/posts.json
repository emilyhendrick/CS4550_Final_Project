    "review": "Got this catered for lunch on a work trip . Not my normal place I would eat but it definitely open my eyes to new healthier types of food I will eat . I got the hot honey chicken plate. The quality of the food is very good, and ton of flavor . You could tell the food was prepped with care and they even took the time to make it look nice . Definitely try it if you've been thinking about it .",
